            <p>Joel Embiid is an NBA player currently playing for the Philadelphia 76ers. He is from the country of
                Cameroon, where he played soccer and volleyball. He was invited to a basketball camp nearby hosted by
                the NBA player Luc Mbah a Moute, and was eventually recruited and encouraged to come to the United
                States and ended up playing basketball for Kansas University. He was drafted third overall by the
                Philadelphia 76ers in 2014, and missed his first two seasons due to an injury. He is currently a 4x
                All-Star and one of the greatest big men to play the game. </p>

                    The Process is never going to end. It's an ongoing thing. I don't think it's ever going to stop. As
                    I
                    have explained before, it's a process for making it to the playoffs, it's another one to make the
                    conference finals, another one to actually go to The Finals and win the championship.
